### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I'm Giuseppe! Elixir engineer with a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering @ University of Bologna (focused on distributed systems and serverless platforms).
* Core committer in what is now [Apache OpenServerless](https://github.com/apache/openserverless).
* I'm a passionate coder and I love trying new programming languages, paradigms and frameworks. I have many side projects like
  - A little serverless platform [FunLess](https://funless.dev) in Elixir, experimenting with WebAssembly functions.
  - A library to make [resizable panels](https://github.com/giusdp/live_pane) in LiveView (Elixir).
  - A [library in Rust](https://github.com/giusdp/bevy_talks) to create dialogues in games for the Bevy game engine.
