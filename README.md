### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I'm Giuseppe! I'm a freelancer and about to finish a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering @ University of Bologna.
* I work mainly on distributed systems and FaaS platforms. Currently researching configuration languages for function scheduling with a side of WebAssembly runtimes and sustainability in cloud computing.
* I also work as a lead engineer for [Nuvolaris](https://www.nuvolaris.io/), a startup in serverless computing, mostly with Go.
* I'm a passionate coder and I love trying new programming languages, paradigms and frameworks. I have many side projects like
  - A little serverless platform [FunLess](https://funless.dev) in Elixir, experimenting with WebAssembly functions.
  - A [plugin to write dialogues](https://github.com/giusdp/bevy_talks) for the [Bevy](https://github.com/giusdp/bevy_talks) game engine (Rust).
