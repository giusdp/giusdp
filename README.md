### Hi there 👋

* I'm Giuseppe! Software engineer with a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering @ University of Bologna (focused on distributed systems and serverless platforms).
* I mainly code in Elixir. I used to code in Go, too. I do small projects in other programming languages (e.g. Rust, Zig, Java, JS/TS)
