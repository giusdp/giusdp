### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I'm Giuseppe! Freelancer with a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering @ University of Bologna.
* I work mostly with Elixir and Go (some SvelteKit as well). Currently Elixir engineer for Vox Group.
* I'm a passionate coder and I love trying new programming languages, paradigms and frameworks. I have many side projects like
  - A little serverless platform [FunLess](https://funless.dev) in Elixir, experimenting with WebAssembly functions.
  - A library to make [resizable panels](https://github.com/giusdp/live_pane) in LiveView (Elixir).
