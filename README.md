### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I'm Giuseppe, an italian developer and Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Bologna.
* I work mainly on distributed systems and serverless platforms. Currently researching configuration languages for scheduling in serverless.
* I also am a Software Engineer at [Nuvolaris](https://www.nuvolaris.io/), a startup in serverless computing (mostly using Go there).
* I'm a passionate coder working on my own projects:
  - A little serverless platform [FunLess](https://funless.dev) in Elixir, experimenting with WebAssembly functions.
  - A [plugin to write dialogues](https://github.com/giusdp/bevy_talks) for the [Bevy](https://github.com/giusdp/bevy_talks) game engine (Rust).
