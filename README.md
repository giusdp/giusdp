### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I'm Giuseppe! I'm a freelancer and Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering.
* I work mainly on distributed systems and serverless platforms. Currently researching configuration languages for function scheduling in FaaS.
* I also work as a lead engineer in [Nuvolaris](https://www.nuvolaris.io/), a startup in serverless computing (mostly using Go there).
* I'm a passionate coder working on a lot of projects:
  - A little serverless platform [FunLess](https://funless.dev) in Elixir, experimenting with WebAssembly functions.
  - A [plugin to write dialogues](https://github.com/giusdp/bevy_talks) for the [Bevy](https://github.com/giusdp/bevy_talks) game engine (Rust).
  - A game with the Zig programming language.
